# SCENARIOS

## Persona 1: Coach McDonald   

_Scenario 1:_ It's been a few days since the last game and the team is now at practice. The Coach would like to highlight top performances from players based on stats. He signs into his **ADMIN ACCOUNT**, selects **STATS**, selects **PLAYER** and then is able to view the stats for each player for any game.  

_Scenario 2:_ Now the coach is done highlighting individual players and would like to discuss team stats. He clicks the **BACK** button to get out of player stats, and this time instead of selecting **PLAYER**, he selects **TEAM**.

_Scenario 3:_ The coach would like to select the starting players for the next game so he signs into his **ADMIN ACCOUNT** and selects **SCHEDULE**. Here he is able to create a **LINE UP** (this is only an admin feature) which will be viewable by the players.

## Persona 2: Team Manager/Parent- Mrs. Warren   

_Scenario 1:_ It's during a game and Mrs. Warren is keeping stats for each player in real time. She has an **ADMIN ACCOUNT** and is already signed in. She navigates to the **STATS** page, selects **PLAYER** and waits. As a player does something she selects that player to fill in the stat (this is only an Admin feature).  

_Scenario 2:_ It's in between games and Mrs. Warren would like to update the team stats. She signs in to her **ADMIN ACCOUNT** and navigates to the **STATS** page, where she then selects between **PLAYER** and **TEAM**- here she will select **TEAM** and fill in the stat.

## Persona 3: Player- Kyle Peterson   

_Scenario 1:_ Kyle has just finished playing a game and would like to check his own stats so he signs into the app under his **PLAYER ACCOUNT** and selects **STATS**. He then selects **PLAYER** and finds his name amongst a list of all the players. He can view his own stats or the other players stats as well.  

_Scenario 2:_ Kyle wants to know who the starters for the upcoming game will be. He signs into the app under his **PLAYER ACCOUNT** and selects **SCHEDULE**. He finds the date for the next game and selects it. This takes him to the **LINE UP** where he can view the starters for each position.
